* Hook Setting

** GitHub

If you use GitHub as a wiki repository, it is easy to setup hooking update.

+ Go to your repository top page. (ex. https://github.com/sotarok/wikihub-wiki)
+ Go to "Admin" page.
+ Go to "Service" Hooks page.
+ Put the ping URL to "Post-Receive URLs"
+- http://wikihub.org/ping/WIKI_NAME
+- WIKI_NAME is the name you registered to wikihub.org


** Subversion

Subversion commit hook is little more complex.

Write later.
